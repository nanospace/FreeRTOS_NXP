Overview
========

The I2S example project uses one I2S interface to continuously record input sound to a buffer
and another I2S interface to playback the buffer to output - digital loopback.

It requires NXP Mic/Audio/Oled Shield with WM8904 codec.
It needs to have 1-2 connected on JP3.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.80.4
- Keil MDK 5.21a
- MCUXpresso0.8

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso54618 board
- Personal Computer
- headphones with 3.5 mm stereo jack
- source of sound (line output to 3.5 mm stereo jack)


Board settings
==============
No special settings are required on LPCXpresso54618 board.

Prepare the Demo
================
Connect a serial cable from the debug UART port of the board to the PC. Start Tera Term
(http://ttssh2.osdn.jp) and make a connection to the virtual serial port.

1. Start Tera Term
2. New connection -> Serial
3. Set apropriate COMx port (x is port number) in Port context menu. Number is provided by operation
   system and could be different from computer to computer. Select COM number related to virtual
   serial port. Confirm selected port by OK button.
4. Set following connection parameters in menu Setup->Serial port...
        Baud rate:    115200
        Data:         8
        Parity:       none
        Stop:         1
        Flow control: one
5.  Confirm selected parameters by OK button.
Running the demo
================
Headphones will play a sine wave sound.
The log below shows example output of the I2S driver demo in the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Configure I2C
Configure WM8904 codec
Configure I2S
Setup looping playback of sine wave
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modify i2s_dma_transfer.c to change condition to call StartDigitalLoopback() instead of StartSoundPlayback() function.
Headphones will play what is input into Audio Line-In connector of MAO shield.
Terminal window will show:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Configure I2C
Configure WM8904 codec
Configure I2S
Setup digital loopback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
