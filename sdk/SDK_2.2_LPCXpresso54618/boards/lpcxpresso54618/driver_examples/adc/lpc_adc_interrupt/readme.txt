Overview
========

The lpc_adc_interrupt example shows how to use interrupt with LPC ADC driver.

In this example, the internal temperature sensor is used to created the input analog signal. When user type in any key from the keyboard, the software trigger API is called to start the conversion. Then it polls the flag variable which would be asserted when the conversion completed ISR is executed. Then just print the conversion result to terminal.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.80.4
- Keil MDK 5.21a
- MCUXpresso0.8

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso54618 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the LPC-Link USB port (J8) on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, following information can be seen on the OpenSDA terminal:

ADC interrupt example.
ADC_DoSelfCalibration() Done.
Configuration Done.
gAdcResultInfoStruct.result        = 675
gAdcResultInfoStruct.channelNumber = 0
gAdcResultInfoStruct.overrunFlag   = 0

gAdcResultInfoStruct.result        = 676
gAdcResultInfoStruct.channelNumber = 0
gAdcResultInfoStruct.overrunFlag   = 0

gAdcResultInfoStruct.result        = 676
gAdcResultInfoStruct.channelNumber = 0
gAdcResultInfoStruct.overrunFlag   = 0
