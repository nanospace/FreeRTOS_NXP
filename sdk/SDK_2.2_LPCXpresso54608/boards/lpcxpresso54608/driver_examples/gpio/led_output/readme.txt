Overview
========
The GPIO Example project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software to manipulate the general-purpose
outputs. The example use LEDs and buttonsto demonstrates GPIO API for port and pin manipulation (init, set,
clear, and toggle).


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.80.4
- Keil MDK 5.21a
- MCUXpresso0.8

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso54608 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
Connect a serial cable from the debug UART port of the board to the PC. Start Tera Term
(http://ttssh2.osdn.jp) and make a connection to the virtual serial port.

1. Start Tera Term
2. New connection -> Serial
3. Set appropriate COMx port (x is port number) in Port context menu. Number is provided by operation
   system and could be different from computer to computer. Select COM number related to virtual
   serial port. Confirm selected port by OK button.
4. Set following connection parameters in menu Setup->Serial port...
        Baud rate:    115200
        Data:         8
        Parity:       none
        Stop:         1
        Flow control: none
5.  Confirm selected parameters by OK button.


Running the demo
================
After the board is flashed the Tera Term will print message on terminal.

Example output:
